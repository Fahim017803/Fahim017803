# Fahim

DevOps-Focused IT Student | Linux & Automation Learner | Sydney 🇦🇺

I am building strong system-level fundamentals in Linux, Git, Networking, and automation — documented publicly through structured daily practice.

---

## 🚀 Current Focus

- 90 Days of DevOps (publicly documented)
- Linux internals & process management
- Shell scripting & CLI automation
- Git & GitHub workflows (reset, rebase, PR, CLI)
- Networking fundamentals (DNS, IP, CIDR, ports)
- CI/CD concepts
- Competitive programming for advanced logical thinking

---

## 🧠 Engineering Mindset

I actively practice algorithmic problem-solving (Codeforces Div2 A/B/C range) to strengthen:

- Logical reasoning under constraints  
- Edge case analysis  
- Time & space complexity optimization  
- Debugging discipline  

Comfortable with C++ STL (vector, map, set, unordered_map, priority_queue) and core algorithmic techniques such as binary search, prefix sums, greedy strategies, and simulation.

Strong problem-solving improves automation reliability and system design decisions.
